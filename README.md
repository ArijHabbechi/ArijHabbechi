💥 **Fun Fact**: When I’m not automating systems, I’m diving into a good book, watching films that make me think, or hitting the gym for a good workout. My fuel? A strong, dark coffee and a playlist that swings between every music genre you can imagine. From jazz to metal, I like my life like my music—**diverse** and **energized**! 🎶☕💪
